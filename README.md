# Guide

Guide is a website to help content editors, moderators, administrators, and other users learn how to use the Wagtail content management system (CMS).

The Wagtail guide will ultimately include:

-   Tutorials
-   How-to articles
-   Reference materials
-   Walkthroughs and visual learning materials

You can learn more about the documentation system [here](https://documentation.divio.com/).

# Installation

We assume that you have basic knowledge of Node/Webpack and Python/Django/Wagtail in these instructions. We recommend you develop Wagtail Guide locally on your machine using `venv` and [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to ensure you are on the correct Node version.

#### Dependencies

-   Git
-   Python >= 3.9
-   Poetry >= 1.2.2
-   Node (see `.nvmrc` for version)

### Setting up Wagtail guide in a virtual environment

Run:

    python -V

Confirm that the output is showing version Python 3.9 (or higher). If not, you may have multiple versions of Python installed on your system and will need to switch to the appropriate version when creating the virtual environment.

With the Python version output confirmed, [install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs).

Now we're ready to set up the guide project:

    cd ~/dev [or your preferred dev directory]
    git clone https://github.com/wagtail/guide.git
    cd guide
    make backend
    make frontend
    make buildfixtures

Once the backend and frontend have been set up, you can run the development server with:

    make run

If everything worked, [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) should show you a welcome page.

You can access the administrative area at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) and log in using the credentials you created during the backend setup.

To activate Poetry's virtual environment, run:

    poetry shell

To generate and compile translation strings, run:

    make translations

### Setting up development with Docker

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root containing these variables, you can adjust the values to your preferences:
    ```
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost
    PORT=8000
    SECRET_KEY=some-random-secret
    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=apps.guide.settings.dev
    ```
2. Build the image by running the `make docker-build` command.
3. Run the container with `make docker-run`.
4. Run the init script in the container: `make docker-init`
5. You should now have access to the project in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`

# Gitpod

With Gitpod you can deploy a ready-to-code Wagtail Guide development environment with a single click to evaluate the code.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/wagtail/guide)

Steps:

1. Click the `Open in Gitpod` button.
2. Relax: a development environment with an active Wagtail Guide site will be created for you.
3. Login at `/admin/` with username `admin` and password `changeme`
