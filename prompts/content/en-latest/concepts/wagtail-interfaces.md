A Wagtail interface is a screen in the Wagtail portal where you can manage a particular content type. The following are the several interfaces available to you in the Wagtail CMS:

## Admin interface

The admin interface is the official name for the entire Wagtail content management portal, from which you can manage your content. It represents the entire part of Wagtail from which you can add content such as text, images, documents, and snippets. You can also perform other non-code operations, whether you are an editor, moderator, or administrator of a Wagtail website.

## Image interface

The Image interface refers to the screen you get when you click **Images** from the [Sidebar](/en-latest/how-to-guides/find-your-way-around/). You can [manage images](/en-latest/how-to-guides/manage-images/) from this interface: add images, add tags to images, or modify the data associated with an existing image record from this interface. Also, you can sort the existing images either alphabetically, by their upload dates, or by their file size.

## Documents interface

The Document interface refers to the screen you get when you click **Documents** from the [Sidebar](/en-latest/how-to-guides/find-your-way-around/). This interface allows you to [manage documents](/en-latest/how-to-guides/manage-documents/) from the Admin interface. On this interface, you can filter existing documents by their collection and perform bulk actions on them by clicking the checkboxes located at the left-hand side of each document.

## Snippets interface

Another interface Wagtail provides is the Snippets interface. The Snippets interface allows you to [manage snippets](/en-latest/how-to-guides/manage-snippets/) on your Wagtail websites.

Snippets are reusable components that you can use in multiple places on your Wagtail website. To access the Snippets interface, click Snippets from the [Sidebar](/en-latest/how-to-guides/find-your-way-around/). To learn how to manage snippets, go to the [Manage snippets](/en-latest/how-to-guides/manage-snippets/) section of this User guide documentation.

## Collections interface

The Collections interface refers to the screen from which you can [manage your collections](/en-latest/how-to-guides/manage-collections/). It's important to understand what collections are and their uses. Collections allow you to control access to specific sets of images and documents. Another way of using collections is by using it to group related images or documents.

## Redirects interface

The Redirects interface refers to the screen from which you can [configure your redirects](/en-latest/how-to-guides/manage-redirects/). For proper context, a redirect helps send visitors and search engines to a new page if your web page becomes unavailable (404). This way, visitors won’t end up on a broken journey that results in a _page not found_.

## Users interface

Wagtail allows you to give multiple users the right to manage the content of your website via the [Admin interface](/en-latest/concepts/wagtail-interfaces/). These users can perform actions simultaneously in your [Admin interface](/en-latest/concepts/wagtail-interfaces/) and the kind of action they can perform depends on the roles assigned to them.

The Users interface is the screen from which you can [manage these users](/en-latest/how-to-guides/manage-users-and-roles/). In the Users interface, you can see a list of all of your users, their usernames, roles, and status. It's also possible to sort this listing either by Name or Username.

## Workflow interface

The Workflow interface is the screen from which you set up your workflows. On this interface, you can add new workflows and access the edit screen, from which you can edit the existing ones.

To learn about Workflows and how to set them up, go to [Configure workflows for the moderation](/en-latest/how-to-guides/configure-workflows-for-moderation/) guide of this User guide documentation.

## Tasks interface

The Workflow interface is the screen from which you set and manage your Workflow tasks. On this interface, you can add new tasks and access the edit screen, from which you can edit the existing ones.

To learn about Workflow tasks and how to set them up, go to [Configure workflows for the moderation](/en-latest/how-to-guides/configure-workflows-for-moderation/) guide of this User guide documentation.

## Edit screen

An edit screen is any screen in the admin interface, from which you can edit your pages, snippets, images, documents, and other items related to the management of your content.
