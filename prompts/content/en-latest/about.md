> The User Guide is a website to help content editors, moderators, administrators, and other users learn how to use the Wagtail content management system (CMS).

The User Guide is a website to help content editors, moderators, administrators, and other users learn how to use [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/), the leading open source Python content management system (CMS). It’s comprehensive documentation for CMS users, including reference information on the admin features, how-tos, and more.

## **AI-friendly documentation**

For users of Large Language Models (LLMs), the user guide contents are available in LLM-friendly formats:

-   [llms.txt](https://guide.wagtail.org/llms.txt), an LLM-focused index of all site contents.
-   [llms-full.txt](https://guide.wagtail.org/llms-full.txt), a full copy of the documentation
-   [llms-prompt.txt](https://guide.wagtail.org/llms-prompt.txt), an opinionated prompt you can copy-paste into your preferred AI tool so it answers questions based on the site’s contents.

Let us know if this is useful to you in our [llms.txt feedback discussion thread](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/13648).
