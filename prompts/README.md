# Website prompts

We use LLMs to help manage the site’s contents and experiment with the [Wagtail AI](https://wagtail.org/wagtail-ai/) package. The main goals are:

- Increased automation for site upkeep. The site and its contents is very time-consuming to maintain, as it has to keep up with updates to Wagtail.
- Increased reusability of the contents. We want the content to be simple to access in its original format but also reusable for custom guides.
- Dogfooding with real-world content. Being able to work on Wagtail features that are only testable with real-world data and use cases.
